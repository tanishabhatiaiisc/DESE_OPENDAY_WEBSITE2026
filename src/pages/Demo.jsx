    description: "The Vein Visualizer is a biomedical device designed to assist healthcare professionals in locating veins for cannulation using Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging. NIR light penetrates the skin and is absorbed differently by blood and surrounding tissues, enhancing vein contrast. The captured vein patterns are processed and displayed on a screen in real-time, allowing medical personnel to identify optimal insertion points. This system is particularly useful for patients with difficult venous access (DVA), such as infants, elderly individuals, and those with obesity or dark skin tones. By improving vein visibility, the device enhances the accuracy of cannulation, reduces multiple needle insertion attempts, and minimizes patient discomfort.",

    name: "Electrical Impedance-based Multiplexed Biosensor for Point-of-Care Diagnosis",
    description: "This project focuses on developing an innovative, cost-effective biosensor multiple analyte detection. The interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on a PCB with a soft gold finish utilize electrical impedance sensing. The IDEs are chemically modified using various surface chemistries to enhance antibody immobilization and stability. This impedance-based biosensor can be tailored with specific bioreceptors to target multiple analytes in a single bioassay. The biosensor is paired with a compact impedance sensing module for precise EIS measurements.Additionally, the project aims to address the limitations of traditional biosensors, which typically detect single analytes and require individual measurements. By designing a simultaneous multiple analyte detection immunosensor array, this project seeks to enable large-scale manufacturing, reduce costs, and create reusable sensors for various scientific and industrial applications, from environmental monitoring to medical diagnostics. This immunosensor is a compact benchtop system that can be used as a reusable point-of-care device, unlike screenprinted electrode-based biosensors. This impedance-based biosensor can be tailored with specific bioreceptors to target various analytes.",
